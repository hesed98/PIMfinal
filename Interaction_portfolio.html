                    <h3 style="text-align: left;font-weight: lighter;margin-left:20px;"> "The Astronaut and the Satellite" is an interactive game, that mainly interacts by sound, formed through mic.</h3>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;margin-left:20px;">Purpose of the Game: </h3>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;font-weight: lighter;margin-left:20px;">
                    It is made to be a healing game. The game is simple and intuitive. There is no gravity nor sounds, except for the sound of your breath and the quiet music. </h3>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;margin-left:20px;">How it works:</h3>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;font-weight: lighter;margin-left:20px;">Users should first use earphones so that the sound of the game and the users’ sound can be separated. After the crying scene of the satellite, wonderfully designed universe comes out with the Astronaut character. Users should blow through the mic and move the character. Like the real universe, the wind makes the character to move. The character will smoothly move and fall with no gravity. After it collects all the particles, the satellite is fixed, and it moves around the universe with the astronaut.

                    <h3 style="text-align: left;font-weight: lighter;margin-left:20px;"> This player is inspired by violin. The purpose of the player is to educate violin beginner to use bow of the violin properly. After playing this, the user would be able to at least play “A little Star” by Mozart. The code runs based on the machine learning by ‘Wekinator’.<br>
                    The above window with a narrow height is a neck of the violin. The user should show their fingers to the web cam and pick the color by pointing it. Each color indicates the melody ( C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C(octave1) ). 
                    <br>The user’s phone is the bow of the violin. The user should grab the phone as they grab a bow, and swing it softly. When the bow is properly worked, through the window behind, played melody’s color will appear. </h3>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;margin-left:20px;">How it works:</h3>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;font-weight: lighter;margin-left:20px;">
                      1. Open 2 Wekinator files and 1 wekiInputHelper file. Then connect your phone osc to the wekiInputHelper. Run the files. (If needed, educate the programs to your own circumstance)
                      <br>2. Play the code. 
                      <br>3. Arrange two windows.
                      <br>4. Set the webcam to face the clearest place. 
                      <br>5. Point the color through webcam with your left hand.
                      <br>6. Grab the phone with your right hand and swing it as you play the violin.
                      <br>7. Enjoy!
                      <br>**If your swinging speed is not appropriate or the bow is heading the wrong way, the sound will not be played.

                    <h3 style="text-align: left;font-weight: lighter;margin-left:20px;"> Music influences our ourselves by touching emotions and thoughts. This project
                    is planned to visualize it. “M” is an interactive media art, that can be enjoyed anywhere.
                    <br>The user is mapped with boxes like a rough pixel. The brightness of the user is
                    considered. Users will get their own image and colors according to their brightness of the
                    place there are in, face expressions, and their own brightness of the skin. When the user
                    inputs the music that he or she wants to fully enjoy, the user’s mapped face’s brightness
                    will change according to the music’s frequency at the moment. Therefore, the user will be
                    able to enjoy music in their own circumstances which leads them to experience the music,
                    and amplify the influence of the music to the user itself.

                      1. Play the code.<br>
                      2. When the code starts, it will automatically request the user to choose the music. Only
                      sound files work.<br>
                      3. The user’s face will be video captured by camera in the computer. According to the
                      video, the face will be mapped to boxes with various colors.<br>
                      4. The boxes’ brightness will change according to the music’s frequency.<br>
                      5. Enjoy!<br>
